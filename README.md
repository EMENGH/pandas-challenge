PANDAS HOMEWORK

DESCRIPTION OF THREE OBSERVABLE TRENDS BASED ON THE DATA





1.	There is no surprise to learn that three of the most popular games are considered the most profitable. This says a lot about the quality and acceptance of these games in the population.

2.	One of the main findings in the Age Demographics category is that almost half of the players are in the 20 to 24 age group, followed in the distance by players in the 15 to 19 age group. These two groups together, represent  almost two thirds of the screened player’s population.

3.	In terms of the player’s gender distribution, it has been noted that more than 80% of the player’s buying games are males, and just about 14% correspond to females. However, it seems that females average purchase is a little bit greater than those of their counterparts. A small remaining percentage corresponds to other/non-disclosed gender.
